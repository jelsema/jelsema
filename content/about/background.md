I hail from Michigan, home of numerous excellent breweries including (but not limited to!)
[Founders](https://foundersbrewing.com/), 
[New Holland](https://www.newhollandbrew.com/), and 
[Bell's](www.bellsbeer.com/). I attended [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/stat/) for a degree in Statistics. followed by graduate school at [Western Michigan University](https://wmich.edu/statistics), where I ultimately earned both a MS and PhD. 

[Rajib Paul](https://publichealth.uncc.edu/directory/rajib-paul) (now at UNC-Charlotte) directed my dissertation which was, broadly speaking, on the topic of methods for large geostatistical datasets that do not follow Normality. I have implemented some of the methods in an very-much-incomplete **R** package [RRSM](https://github.com/jelsema/RRSM).

After finishing my PhD [Shyamal Peddada](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/shyamal-peddada) (now at University of Pittsburgh) offered my as postdoctoral research position at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. We worked on some spatial methods (in particular, [Threshold Knot Selection](https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2019-threshold-knots/)), but he also introduced me to the area of order-restricted inference. With him I wrote the R package [CLME](https://github.com/jelsema/CLME), which implements a constrained linear mixed effects model using nonparametric bootstrap for inference.

After my post-doc, I was an assistant professor at West Virginia University. While there I  worked with researchers in a variety of disciplines including Forensics, Geography, and Medicine. For various reasons, I left academia and joined a research lab where I am in a Statistics group assisting mostly engineers who are working on interesting and important projects.
