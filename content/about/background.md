I hail from Michigan, home of numerous excellent breweries including (but not limited to!)
[Founders](https://foundersbrewing.com/), 
[New Holland](https://www.newhollandbrew.com/), and 
[Bell's](www.bellsbeer.com/).

I attended [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/stat/) for a degree in Statistics. While there I developed an appreciation for the general process of learning from data. I also learned and enjoyed working with the SAS programming language (I've since repented). I knew I wanted to get a graduate degree, so after finishing my BS I started at [Western Michigan University](https://wmich.edu/statistics), ultimately earning both a MS and PhD.

While there, I took a course on Spatial statistics from my future PhD advisor [Rajib Paul](https://publichealth.uncc.edu/directory/rajib-paul) (now at UNC-Charlotte). I really enjoyed the idea of spatial data, and have kept a toe in those waters ever since. My dissertation was, broadly speaking, on the topic of methods for large geostatistical datasets that do not follow Normality. I have implemented some of the methods in an very-much-incomplete **R** package [RRSM](https://github.com/jelsema/RRSM).

After finishing my PhD I was fortunate to be offered a post-doctoral position at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences by [Shyamal Peddada](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/shyamal-peddada) (now at University of Pittsburgh). With Shyamal I continued working on some spatial methods (in particular, [Threshold Knot Selection](https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2019-threshold-knots/)), but he also introduced me to the area of order-restricted inference. With him I wrote the R package [CLME](https://github.com/jelsema/CLME), which implements a constrained linear mixed effects model using nonparametric bootstrap for inference.

Since August 2015, I have been an assistant professor at West Virginia University. Here I've connected with and been able to collaborate with researchers in a variety of disciplines including Forensics, Geography, and medicine. 
I get to teach practical data analysis techniques through R, and I get to work on whatever statistical methodology I want, as well as analyze real data with other professors or their grad students.
