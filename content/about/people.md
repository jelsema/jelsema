## [Rajib Paul](https://publichealth.uncc.edu/directory/rajib-paul)

Rajib introduced me to both spatial and bayesian statistics. As my PhD advisor, he was intrumental on guiding me along the path to research in statistical methods.


## [Shyamal Peddada](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/shyamal-peddada)

Shyamal took a chance and offered me my first professonal job as a post-doctoral fellow. 
He picked up where Rajib left off, teaching me more about the world of research, and helped to push me further along on the path of independent scholarship.


## [Bradford Dykes](https://dykesb.github.io/)

Bradford and I attended GVSU and WMU together. We often brainstormed about how to make introductory statistics more modern, accessible, and exciting - particularly for non-majors.
