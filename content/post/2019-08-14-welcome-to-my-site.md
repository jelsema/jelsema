Welcome! If you've found your way to this page ... well, I'm more than a little surprised. This is my personal website. I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing here. My plan at the moment is to use it mainly for:

- Listing professional things like publications independently of my place of employment.
- Host the slides for talks or workshops that I give.

I may have some posts (is that 'blogging'? Save me!) about topics that pique my interest. This would likely be my thoughts on some bit of Statistics or science that came across my screen. But who knows, maybe I'll post about Lord of the Rings or some other fantasy or sci-fi that I enjoy.

I expect to have a grand total of zero readers. But since you're here, clearly I'm mistaken. Enjoy!
