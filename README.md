This repository has the content for making my personal site. 
My method of delivery only uses the 'produced' files, so I'm keeping the source files here in case something happens and I lose everything.

The website can be found at [jelsema.github.io](https://jelsema.github.io)

# Until I figure out how to fix the "Push" button, use this shell command

  git push -u origin master
  
# Go into Website/jelsema, not Website/Main, latter is an archive of sorts.
